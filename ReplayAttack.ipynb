    "In this module we will be using a simple RF radio device, a **remote control** and **HackRF** in order to receive and transmit signals. This remote is used to turn on and off the lights. Remote has A, B, and OnOff keys on it. We will first give signal from original transmitter, capture it, and see if we can replay it later. Also, you can find already recorded IQ files in the folder. These exist `HighTek_A.dat`, `HighTek_B.dat`, and `HighTek_OnOff.dat` files. In the first part we will use HackRF along with **GNU Radio**, in the second part **HackRF tool `hackrf_transfer`** will be used. In the third part, RF data from the remote control will be analyzed and decoded. \n",

You would use such a band is because it's unlicensed in that you are allowed to use equipment that operates in that band without you having a license yourself. There may be rules however about the authorization of the equipment even though there aren't rules about the authorization of the user of the equipment so we call those unlicensed bands. \n",

    "What we have seen so far is **simple** capture and replay attack. It's pretty good considering how easy it is to accomplish. But keep in mind that we didn't have to decode this signal, we didn't have to even understand what the modulation was. Even if we don't know what the modulation is, we could still capture a signal once we've identified it and then replay it and find out if that replay actually does anything. It's a pretty powerful tool to have in our toolbox being able to replay a signal. It's useful for testing systems to see if they respond to a replay packet and it's also extremely useful to create a as a means of creating a repeatable test vector that we can use. \n",

We can change things like the FFT size which which affects the height of the analysis and we can change the zoom which affects the width. We can also change the color scheme depending on basically setting thresholds of which color are applied to which colors are applied to which power levels.

The frequency is nearly consistent because everything falls in a horizontal line but the power level goes on and off very dramatically. You can see this is the\n",

    "Let's take a closer look at one of the bursts. Zooming in on time axis, we can see clearly that  it transmits for a while and then it's just back to noise and then it transmits for a while and then we're back to noise again. Let's take a look at how we can demodulate this and the nice thing is that Inspectrum actually has some built-in demodulation capability. You have to kind of do a lot of things by hand but you can demodulate a signal like this using nothing but in Inspectrum. So, we know that the amplitude is being modulated here the transmitter is basically being switched from full amplitude to zero amplitude that is completely off so what we need to do is add an **amplitude plot**. The the red line in the center is the center frequency of my tuning and the white lines at the top and bottom are showing the edges of the filter that I'm using to filter this channel and so you can kind of adjust if you want a wider filter you can drag them out and if you want a narrower filter. \n",

    "We can start by using cursor for one bit period but eventually once you have the cursor set up properly you can also use them to demodulate and extract data from things. Just looking at kind of one bit period where the transmitter is on you can get a rough idea how long burst will be. Then gradually increase symbol count to 10, 50, and finally to 100. Make sure that we're staying lined up with the bit periods there like my dotted lines are lining up exactly with the bit transitions. So, once you have everything lined up and we're lined up on the threshold plot you can right click there and say **extract symbols**. You can either go to standard output or to the  clipboard. If you choose clipboard, clipboard should have a set of bits okay one zero one zero one zero that sounds about right for the start of the signal and then eventually we get into where the actual bits of the message are. \n",
